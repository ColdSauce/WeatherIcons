What is it?

*WeatherIcons* is a collection of, well, weather icons. The repository includes image files of each icon (in both PNG and SVG) as well as several font files (TTF, OTF, SVG, WOFF).

Why bother?
----

In coming up with our newest app, NOW Weather, we found the need for a high quality set of weather icons that fit the look we were going for. As we progressed through development, we realized the benefits of an icon font to allow us to dynamically size the icons. Adam Whitcroft's *Climacon* [icons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/) and [font](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/font/) did the job nicely during development.

However, after staring at them day after day, and seeing the *Climacons* start to show up just about everywhere (because they really are a fantastic choice), we decided to go a different direction.

So here we present Kickstand App's own *WeatherIcons*. While inspired by the *Climacons*, these icons were developed entirely from scratch to provide an alternative, both for us with NOW Weather, as well as for whoever would like to use them in their own project.

Who can use it?
---------------

In short, pretty much anyone, for pretty much any purpose.

Everything is released under the SIL OFL 1.1 License as listed in [License.txt](https://github.com/kickstandapps/WeatherIcons/blob/master/License.txt)

Whether you modify the icons or use them as they are, an attribution would be appreciated, though not required.

How to use it?
--------------

The image files can be used just like any other image files. The included fonts have the icons mapped to the alphabet as seen below:

Want to contribute?
-------------------

We hope you like what we've come up with. But we know as well as anyone that it won't fit everyone's needs. If you expand or otherwise improve the icon set, please submit the change as a pull request. While we will only incorporate the changes that fit the style and intent of the original set, we hope to see numerous additions and improvements to the originals that we will add to the official icon set (with full credit, obviously).
